# 4d-google-docs
A 4D project for accessing and maniuplating your google docs and spreadsheets.
This library assumes that you are using the [Service Account method of accessing Google Docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#serviceaccount).  This technique allows your app to operate from a server, and have access to your all google accounds for your domain.
If you are trying to set up an app that will be for individual users and not an entire domain, you would use [one of several other configurations](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#scenarios).

## Steps
1. [Setup your app in Google](https://github.com/macMikey/4d-google-docs/blob/master/README/1.%20Setup%20Google.md)
2. Download and install the [JWT plugin](https://github.com/miyako/4d-plugin-jwt) into your *Plugins* folder.  See the [README](https://github.com/miyako/4d-plugin-jwt/blob/master/README.md) for installation instructions.
3. Check out the `aTest` method for a very basic sample.
